## Assignment Objectives
For your first submission, you were asked to submit an introductory blog of yourself that outlined areas of 
interest in your learning and other personal goals throughout the DSPG program. This blog will be a reflection 
of the progress you are making as the program reaches the midpoint. 

## What to Include in This Blog
As you prepare this blog, please share some of the work you've been doing. This is a way for external audiences
to see the skills you've been building throughout the program. The context of the blog should include
some answers to the following questions.

- What have you been learning so far?
  - This encompasses both the technical and non technical knowledge you're gaining.
  - What are some new skills you've picked up & skills you're developing from before?
- Demonstrate some of the work from your learning.
  - This could be an example of a data transformation code, a visualization, a map, etc.
- Indicate any new directions of learning that you've been pursuing during the program. 
  - Why are you pursuing them?
- What skills are you hoping to improve for the rest of the program?
- Do you think that you're meeting the goals you've outlined at the start of the program?

## Before Submitting Your Assignment 

- Please update everything except the `categories: ["Midpoint Reflection"]` in the YAML metadata section of your `NAME_Midpoint_Blog.qmd` file. 
- Replace the `NAME` section of the `NAME_Midpoint_Blog.qmd` file with your first name. 
- If you are including any images, place them in the `imgs\` folder and follow the guidelines discussed in the [Blog Writing Guidelines post](add link) for adding images.
  - The same practice holds for data to be in the `data` folder.
-   Render the blog post locally on your device to make sure that it can render correctly. If you are in RStudio, you can use the Render icon or hit `Ctrl+Shift+K` on Windows and `Shift-Command-K` on Mac.

## Using Python Code Chunks

If you are using python in your code chunks you will need to run the following at the top of your code, after the library imports. Set the following chunks to `eval=TRUE`.

```{r}
# Library for running python code in RStudio.
library(reticulate)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Check for virtual environment, if it doesn't exist, create the venv, if it exists
# then use the venv called "r-python"

if (virtualenv_exists("r-python")) {
  use_virtualenv("r-python")
} else {
  virtualenv_create("r-python")
  use_virtualenv("r-python")
}
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Installing dependencies for the python virtualenv

virtualenv_install(envname = "r-python", packages = c("numpy", "pandas", "scikit-learn"), all = TRUE)
```
